# 🐾 Animal Classification using CNN & Streamlit

This project is an **Animal Image Classification System** built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model and a **Streamlit web interface**.  
It allows users to upload an animal image, and the system predicts the type of animal using deep learning.
